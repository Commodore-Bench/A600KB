# A600KB Keyboard project for Amiga 600

Like my A1200 project (see my other repos) this is a mechanical keyboard for an Amiga computer.

To make this project you need:
- PCBs, which you can make by sending the contents of the 'fab' folder to your local PCB maker.
- 3D printed parts: the STL files are in the STL folder. I used a Prusa MK3S 0.25mm nozzle, Urban Grey PETG.
- 78 MX PCB-mount switches
- 32-way FFC connector (Mouser part number 538-52044-3245)
- 32-way ribbon cable (Mouser part number 538-15168-0400)
- keyswitch stabiliser for Tab and Enter keys
- one 3mm LED for CapsLock
- keycaps

Enjoy!
